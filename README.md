# Empirical-Analysis-Of-Approximation-Algorithms

This repository contains the soruce code and findings for my Design Project (BITS Pilani â€“ CS F376).

## Overview

- Implemented several heuristics for the Vertex Cover, Set Cover, and Traveling Salesman problem in Python.

- Programmed benchmark solutions using brute force and Integer Linear Programming (ILP) methods.

- Generated tables and 2D/3D graphs by changing parameters such as number of vertices and graph density.

- Conducted a comparative analysis of the above algorithms based on execution time and performance ratio against benchmarks.
